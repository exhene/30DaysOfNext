# TestingNextJS

Next.js is a React-based open-source framework used for building server-side rendered (SSR) web applications. It enables developers to create dynamic web pages with features such as code splitting, server-side rendering, and automatic static optimization.

Next.js includes built-in support for client-side routing, which allows for the creation of single-page applications. It also supports various data fetching methods, including fetching data at build time, request time, and static generation.

Next.js offers several benefits for developers, including improved performance and SEO, better user experience, and faster development cycles. Additionally, it has a large and active community that provides ongoing support, documentation, and tutorials.
